                <p class="date">22/01/2024</p>
                <p>The last week of January 2024 promises to be an exciting one in the Northeast, with a flurry of sports events and changing weather conditions. The Northwestern Wildcats, with a record of 13-5, are gearing up to host the Illinois Fighting Illini, who hold a slightly better record of 14-4. This thrilling competition will be held indoors at the Welsh-Ryan Arena on Wednesday, January 24, 2024, thereby minimizing the impact of the unpredictable weather conditions.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, some of the Northeast's best young ski jumpers braved the cold outdoors at the country's oldest ski club. The Eastern Ski Jumping Meet, held during Milan's 102nd annual winter carnival, witnessed an impressive display of speed, skill, and sometimes spills, underlining the comeback of the once-popular winter sport.</p>
                <p>Amid the adrenaline rush of these sports events, the weather in the Northeast is also exhibiting its own dramatic spectacle. After an arctic blast that left over 80 victims, a major thaw is predicted across the United States, exposing millions to a new threat of heavy rain and flooding. Forecasters predict a surge of moisture that will trigger rain, ice, and snow from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast from Monday night to Wednesday. This drastic change in weather is sure to impact outdoor sports events and the preparations of the organizers and participants.</p>
                <p>Despite the frigid temperatures, sports events continue to unfold. The Northwestern Wildcats faced a close defeat against Nebraska, 75-69 on Saturday afternoon. The thrilling game saw Nebraska secure a win for the first time since 2019 against the Wildcats, thanks to a deep 3-pointer shot by Keisei Tominaga in the last 25 seconds. This indoor game, unaffected by the cold weather, added an extra layer of challenge for the athletes.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, the Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles are set to break their four-game losing streak as they host the Western Illinois Leathernecks indoors on Thursday, January 25, 2024. The Screaming Eagles are eager to improve their 5-15 record, while the Leathernecks stand strong with a 12-7 record. As the Northeast braces for more snow and ice, the region's sports scene remains as heated as ever. The indoor game will not be directly impacted by the forecasted snow and ice, but travel arrangements for the teams and spectators will require careful planning.</p>
