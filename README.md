# GPT Newspaper

Welcome to the GPT Newspaper project, an innovative autonomous agent designed to create personalized newspapers tailored to user preferences. GPT Newspaper revolutionizes the way we consume news by leveraging the power of AI to curate, write, design, and edit content based on individual tastes and interests.

## 🔍 Overview

GPT Newspaper consists of six specialized sub-agents in LangChain's new [LangGraph Library](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph):

1. **Search Agent**: Scours the web for the latest and most relevant news.
2. **Curator Agent**: Filters and selects news based on user-defined preferences and interests.
3. **Writer Agent**: Crafts engaging and reader-friendly articles.
4. **Designer Agent**: Layouts and designs the articles for an aesthetically pleasing reading experience.
5. **Editor Agent**: Constructs the newspaper based on produced articles.
6. **Publisher Agent** Publishes the newspaper to the frontend or desired service

Each agent plays a critical role in delivering a unique and personalized newspaper experience.
